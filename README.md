## Alexa Skills Kit (ASK)
Alexa, the voice personality of Echo and other Amazon voice-enabled devices, has her capabilities broken down into 'skills'. A skill is one subject, knowledge area, or functional tool that Alexa can understand and fulfill. Some built-in skills are like getting the weather and getting sports stats. 

Developers can create and register *custom skills* and *smart home* skills.

*Custom Skills* allow the user to say something like 'Alexa get the high tide for Seatle from TidePooler'. This is the standard interaction model that includes the wake word 'Alexa' the skill name 'TidePooler' and the request ' high tide for Seatle' plus some interchangeable filler words.
